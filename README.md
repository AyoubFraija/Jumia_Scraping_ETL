## General Information
The pipeline systematically gathers data from the Jumia website through web scraping, capturing crucial details like product names, prices, ratings, and seller information. Subsequently, this raw data undergoes a transformation process before being loaded into both a MySQL database and a CSV file. Airflow plays a pivotal role in orchestrating the entire ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. As a final step, the data stored in the CSV file serves as the foundation for creating a dashboard
